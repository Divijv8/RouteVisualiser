# Route Visualizer

### Overview  
**Route Visualizer** is an interactive graphical tool built using **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)** that demonstrates the working of fundamental graph algorithms like **Dijkstra's**, **Prim's**, and **Kruskal's**. This project provides a visually engaging way to explore and understand these algorithms, showcasing their applications in routing, pathfinding, and spanning tree construction.

### Features  
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Visualize shortest path calculation based on edge weights (e.g., traffic or distance).  
- **Prim's Algorithm**: Observe how a minimum spanning tree is constructed incrementally.  
- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Watch the union-find approach in action for building a minimum spanning tree.  
- **Interactive Visualization**:  
  - Nodes represent locations (e.g., houses or restaurants).  
  - Edges represent paths between locations with associated weights.  
  - Real-time animation of algorithm execution.  
- **Customizations**:  
  - Add nodes and edges dynamically.  
  - Set weights to edges representing real-world constraints like traffic or distance.  
  - Highlight optimal routes and spanning trees.  

### Use Case  
The tool is ideal for learning and teaching graph algorithms. It also demonstrates practical applications like food delivery routing, traffic optimization, and network design.

### Tech Stack  
- **Language**: C++  
- **Graphics Library**: SFML  

### How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
2. Build the project using your favorite C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++) and link it with SFML.  
3. Run the executable to start the visualizer.
